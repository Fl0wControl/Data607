Load the required libraries and create a variable for the URL

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(httr)

url <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists.json?api-key=8074adfeb5a1414e8943e3a2278c51e7?list=hardcover-fiction"
```

Use the JSONlite library to read the results of the url GET request into a json object in R. After that is completed, transform it into an R data frame.
```{r}
jsonResponse <- fromJSON(url)

jsonDF <- as.data.frame(jsonResponse)
```

Now that the data is in a data frame, we can group the data together by certain variables. Lets get some basic book information.
```{r}
names(jsonDf)

groupedDF <-  jsonDF %>% select(results.title, results.author, results.age_group, results.price)

groupedDF
```

In order to present a nice layout of the data, we can use the kable function in the knitr library. We can then use this to find
patterns or variables that would make a worth while analysis.
```{r}
kable(groupedDF)
```
