```{r}
library(RPostgreSQL)
```

## Reading Data into R from Postgres
We will want to use the postgres driver to connect, and we need to
provide our login credentials to build a connection string

```{r}
con <- dbConnect(PostgreSQL(), user="postgres", password="password",dbname="postgres")
```

## Making data frames
Once we have the database connection, we need to create R variables and assign them the data from our tables
```{r}
friends <- dbReadTable(con, c("friends"))
movies <- dbReadTable(con, c("movies"))
ratings <- dbReadTable(con, c("ratings"))
```

## Analyzing the data
With data in R, we can now run R commands against the data, like summary. Here, we will get the summary of the ratings table
```{r}
summary (ratings)
```
